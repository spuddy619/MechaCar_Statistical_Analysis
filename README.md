 Looking at the above image we can conclude:<br>
 1.) The following variables are unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the linear model:<br/>
 -vehicle_length (p-value: 2.60e-12)<br/>
 -ground_clearance (p-value: 5.21e-08)<br/>
 These two variables are statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the linear model; essentially, this means that these two variables are significantly impacting the miles per gallon on the car prototypes.
 
 
 2.) The slope of the linear modelis not zero. When the slope of a linear model is zero, the null hypothesis is true. The p-value of the linear model is 5.35e-11; this is much lower than the assumed level of significance (0.05). This means that we must reject our null hypothesis and this consequently means that the slope is not zero. <br/>
